# Neural Network on MNIST with NumPy from Scratch
Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch).

## Project Description:

Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The neural network should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. It should achieve 97-98% accuracy on the Test Set.
